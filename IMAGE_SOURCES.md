# Seattle Tourist Attraction Images - Replacement Guide

## Current Image Updates Made

I've updated the "You are probably thinking..." section images in `app/page.tsx` to use more descriptive names:

1. **space-needle-skyline.jpg** (main large image) - Should show Space Needle with Seattle skyline
2. **pike-place-market.jpg** (bottom left) - Should show iconic Pike Place Market scenes
3. **seattle-waterfront.jpg** (bottom right) - Should show Seattle waterfront with views
